7//39F4//A//39//Which statement is NOT true regarding the SART? //Responds to interrogations by a vessel's X-Band radar and transmits a signal.//This is a 6 GHz transponder capable of being received by a vessel's X-band navigational radar system.//This is a 9 GHz transponder capable of being received by a vessel's X-band navigational radar system.//Transmits a distinctive 12-blip signal for easy recognition.//B
7//39F5//A//39//At what point does a SART begin transmitting? //It immediately begins radiating when placed in the "on" position.//If it has been placed in the "on" position, it will respond when it has been interrogated by a 9-GHz radar signal.//It must be manually activated or water activated before radiating.//If it has been placed in the "on" position, it will begin transmitting immediately upon detecting that it is in water.//B

7//40F1//A//40//How does the searching vessel's radar interrogate a survival craft SART? //Activate the IFF interrogation system.//The SART responds automatically and transmits the 12-blip signal when it detects the search craft or other vessels' X-Band radar signal.//Maintains watch on VHF-FM Ch-70 for the SART's unique identifier.//The SART responds automatically when it detects the search craft or other vessel's 10-cm radar signal.//B
7//40F2//A//40//What radar display changes indicate the correct approach to a SART and what care should be taken in a SAR situation? //The line of dots indicate the SART's position, the dots become increasing arcs as the distance to the SART lessens, rescuing vessels should increase speed  to reach Distress more quickly.//A line of dots on a radar screen rotates to indicate the SART's position along its line of bearing; rescuing vessels should steer for the center of the line of dots.//The line of dots indicate the SART's position, the dots become increasing arcs as the distance to the SART lessens, rescuing vessels should reduce speed as the arcs get greater in degree.//The line of dots indicate the SART's position, the dots become decreasing arcs as the distance to the SART lessens, rescuing vessels should reduce speed as the arcs lessen in degree.//C
7//40F3//A//40//How can rescue personnel detect that a SART is transmitting in the immediate vicinity? //The DSC unit will react to the SART's signal and respond with the two-tone auto alarm.//The SART can provide an approximate location to within a two nautical mile radius, per IMO standards.//The SART signal appears as a target which comes and goes; the effect of heavy swells on a SART.//The SART's dots on the PPI will become arcs and then eventually become concentric circles.//D
7//40F4//A//40//What signal is detected as originating from an AIS SART and how is the signal displayed? //An AIS SART signal is shown on any AIS receiver as a special MMSI-like coded symbol.//The 3-cm radar reflections are converted to AIS signals and displayed on ECDIS/ARPA screens.//An AIS SART transmits on AIS frequencies and the signals are converted to 3-cm radar targets for display on 3-cm radars.//An AIS SART transmits on 9 GHz so that a 3-cm radar can display the signals.//A
7//40F5//A//40//How can vessel personnel detect the operation of a SART in its vicinity? //A unique two-tone "warbling" signal heard on VHF-FM Ch-70.//It will activate an AIS new signal alarm on the AIS receiver.//The SART signal appears as a target that comes and goes--due to the effect of heavy swells on a SART.//A unique 3-cm signal consisting of a 12-dot pattern radiating outward from a SART's position along its line of bearing.//D
7//40F6//A//40//What is not an advantage of an AIS SART signal when compared to a radar-based SART signal? //The AIS SART can be detected much farther away than radar SART models.//Not every AIS transmission needs to be received to achieve an accurate presentation of the location.//The AIS SART position has GPS accuracy and transmits on AIS VHF frequencies.//AIS SART units may be easier to find in poor radar target conditions.//A
7//41F1//A//41//Which of the following statements concerning testing and maintenance of SARTs is true? //Testing a SART should be done in a consistent manner & location to ensure a baseline history of proper results.//Testing of the SART should never be done in port to prevent interference to other vessel-s radars.//A SART's battery must be replaced within ninety (90) days after the expiration date imprinted on the unit.//An at-sea GMDSS maintainer is not able to test a SART because it is hermetically sealed.//A
7//41F2//A//41//Why is it important to limit the duration of testing a SART? //Excessive testing causes "burn in" on the vessel's radar display.//Testing in port or even at sea may cause interference to other radars or a test signal may be misinterpreted as a genuine Distress situation.//To prevent overheating, a SART requires sufficient ventilation that is significantly reduced when the SART is being tested.//If another SART is testing at the same time, the two signals will cause damage to the unit that transmitted them.//B
7//41F3//A//41//What statement is true regarding tests and maintenance that could be provided for the SART? //Full verification within manufacturer's specifications by the on-board maintainer would be a requirement for all vessels in the A3 & A4 sea areas using measuring equipment to generate 9 GHz signals.//Battery should be replaced within the 90 day grace period following the manufacturer's expiration date shown on the SART and the SART should only be tested at-sea to reduce interference to other vessels.//Extreme care should be exercised because testing of the SART may be received by other vessels, may be interpreted as a Distress condition, or it may interfere with other vessels' safe navigation.//Battery should be replaced with a new one before the manufacturer's expiration date shown on the SART and the SART should only be tested in port to reduce interference to other vessels.//C
