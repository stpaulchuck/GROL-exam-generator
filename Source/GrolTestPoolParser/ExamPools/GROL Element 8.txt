Key Topic 49 – Installation 
 
8-49F1  Why is coaxial cable often used for S-band installations instead of a waveguide? 
    A.  Losses can be kept reasonable at S-band frequencies and the installation cost is lower. 
    B.  A waveguide will not support the power density required for modern S-band RADAR transmitters. 
    C.  S-band waveguide flanges show too much leakage and are unsafe for use near personnel. 
    D.  Dimensions for S-band waveguide do not permit a rugged enough installation for use by ships at sea. 
 
8-49F2  RADAR interference to a communications receiver is eliminated by: 
    A.  Not operating other devices when RADAR is in use. 
    B.  Properly grounding, bonding, and shielding all units. 
    C.  Using a high pass filter on the power line. 
    D.  Using a link coupling. 
 
8-49F3  Why should long horizontal runs of waveguide be avoided? 
    A.  They must be insulated to prevent electric shock. 
    B.  To prevent damage from shipboard personnel. 
    C.  To minimize reception of horizontally polarized returns. 
    D.  To prevent accumulation of condensation. 
 
8-49F4  Long horizontal sections of waveguides are not desirable because: 
    A.  Moisture can accumulate in the waveguide. 
    B.  The waveguide can sag, causing loss of signal. 
    C.  Excessive standing waves can occur. 
    D.  The polarization of the signal might shift. 
 
8-49F5  In a RADAR system, waveguides should be installed: 
    A.  Slightly bent for maximum gain. 
    B.  As straight as possible to reduce distortion. 
    C.  At 90 degree angles to improve resonance. 
    D.  As long as possible for system flexibility. 
 
8-49F6  What is the most important factor to consider in locating the antenna? 
    A.  Allow the shortest cable/waveguide run. 
    B.  Maximum height for best long range operation. 
    C.  The antenna is in a location that is not shadowed by other structures. 
    D.  Easy access for maintenance.

Key Topic 50 – Safety 
 
8-50F1  Choose the most correct statement with respect to component damage from electrostatic discharge: 
    A.  ESD damage occurs primarily in passive components which are easily identified and replaced. 
    B.  ESD damage occurs primarily in active components which are easily identified and replaced. 
    C.  The technician will feel a small static shock and recognize that ESD damage has occurred to the circuit. 
    D.  ESD damage may cause immediate circuit failures, but may also cause failures much later at times when 
the RADAR set is critically needed. 
 
8-50F2  Before testing a RADAR transmitter, it would be a good idea to: 
    A.  Make sure no one is on the deck. 
    B.  Make sure the magnetron’s magnetic field is far away from the magnetron. 
    C.  Make sure there are no explosives or flammable cargo being loaded. 
    D.  Make sure the Coast Guard has been notified. 
 
8-50F3  While making repairs or adjustments to RADAR units: 
    A.  Wear fire-retardant clothing. 
    B.  Discharge all high-voltage capacitors to ground. 
    C.  Maintain the filament voltage. 
    D.  Reduce the magnetron voltage. 
 
8-50F4  While removing a CRT from its operating casing, it is a good idea to: 
    A.  Discharge the first anode. 
    B.  Test the second anode with your fingertip. 
    C.  Wear gloves and goggles. 
    D.  Set it down on a hard surface. 
 
8-50F5  If a CRT is dropped: 
    A.  Most likely nothing will happen because they are built with durability in mind. 
    B.  It might go out of calibration. 
    C.  The phosphor might break loose. 
    D.  It might implode, causing damage to workers and equipment. 
 
8-50F6  Prior to removing, servicing or making measurements on any solid state circuit boards from the RADAR 
set, the operator should ensure that: 
    A.  The proper work surfaces and ESD grounding straps are in place to prevent damage to the boards from 
electrostatic discharge. 
    B.  The waveguide is detached from the antenna to prevent radiation. 
    C.  The magnetic field is present to prevent over-current damage or overheating from occurring in the 
magnetron. 
    D.  Only non-conductive tools and devices are used.
