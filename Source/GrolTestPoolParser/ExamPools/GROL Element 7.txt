four (4) hours. 
D. The GMDSS Radio Operator is responsible for properly selecting VHF & MF DSC guard channels but the HF 
frequencies are done automatically by the watch receiver. 
 
27D2 What is the action that a GMDSS Radio Operator should take when a DSC Distress alert is received 
requesting J3E? 
 
A. No action is necessary, as the DSC control unit will automatically switch to the SITOR (NBDP) follow-on 
communications frequency. 
B. The Operator should immediately set continuous watch on VHF channel 70. 
C. The Operator should immediately set continuous watch on the SITOR (NBDP) frequency that is associated 
with frequency band on which the Distress alert was received.

with frequency band on which the Distress alert was received. 
 
27D3 What does the DSC control unit do if the GMDSS Radio Operator fails to insert updated information when 
initiating a DSC Distress alert? 
 
A. It will initiate the DSC Distress alert and default information will automatically be transmitted. 
B. It will abort the transmission and set off an audible alarm that must be manually reset. 
C. It will initiate the DSC Distress alert but, as no information will be transmitted, rescue personnel will not be 
able to identify the vessel, its position, or its situation. 
D. It will initiate the DSC Distress alert, but any station receiving it will have to establish contact with the   
distressed vessel to determine its identity, position, and situation. 
 
27D4 A DSC Distress alert:  
 
A. Must always be sent on VHF Ch-70. 
B. Will always be sent on one or more of the DSC Distress frequencies. 
C. Must always be sent on MF 2 MHz plus one other HF DSC frequency. 
D. Must always be sent on VHF Ch-70, then 2 MHz MF then 8 MHz HF. 
 
27D5 In all cases, the transmit frequency of a MF/HF console DSC Distress alert:  
 
A. Will always go out first on 2187.5 kHz. 
B. Depends upon operator DSC Call set up entries or manufacturer’s defaults. 
C. Will go out on 8 MHz and 2 MHz and one other DSC Distress frequency. 
D. Will always go out first on 8414.5 kHz to ensure receipt by a coast station. 
 
27D6 DSC relays of Distress alerts by vessels: 
 
A. Should be done for all Distress alerts received aboard the ship.

B. If all satellite channels are busy then one of them will be preempted by a Distress request. 
C. Any Distress request is automatically switched to an Inmarsat Distress working frequency. 
D. Any request message with Distress priority is automatically recognized by the LES and a satellite channel is instantly assigned. 
 
75I2 In what way(s) may a Distress message be initiated through Inmarsat? 
 
A. By transmitting the Distress message on the U.S. Coast Guard's dedicated monitoring channel. 
B. By adding the word "Distress" in the first line of the message's preamble. 
C. All Inmarsat units must use a dedicated key that can be pressed for immediate action. 
D. By pressing dedicated key(s) for this purpose or using menu-driven features to produce a Distress priority message. 
 
75I3 How is an Inmarsat Distress priority message ordinarily initiated on board the vessel? 
 
A. By pressing one or more dedicated "Distress key" controls on the equipment. 
B. By dialing the correct code on the telephone remote unit. 
C. By contacting the LES operator and announcing a Distress condition is in progress. 
D. By contacting the LES operator using the radiotelephone Distress procedure "Mayday”... etc. 
 
75I4 What must be done to disconnect an incoming TELEX message when voice Distress communications is desired via Inmarsat-B?

B. Depressing the "Distress" button automatically disconnects incoming messages. 
C. It is necessary to wait until the incoming TELEX message has concluded otherwise a system fault will occur. 
D. Depress the "Reset" switch to disconnect incoming message. 
 
75I5 Why is the correct selection of the LES in the Distress Alert Setup menu so crucial? 
 
A. Each LES has its own dedicated RCC whose jurisdiction is defined by the LES selected.  
B. The LES choice determines the nationality of the RCC which will handle the Distress traffic and perform SAR duties or that will pass the particulars to the RCC with jurisdiction to coordinate the SAR situation. 
C. Inmarsat terminals use the GPS position to automatically determine the optimum LES choice in a Distress situation. 
D. The vessel need not select the LES because the NCS will always intercept a Distress priority call and route it to the closest RCC. 
 
75I6 If an Inmarsat Distress Alert Setup menu contains an incorrect or unavailable LES code what happens to the Distress Alert transmission? 
 
A. The NCS updates the LES codes in the Distress Alert Setup menu as the vessel moves from ocean region to ocean region to ensure this does not happen.

Section-J: MF-HF Equip. and Comms: Key Topic #98: MF-HF DSC Controller Alert/Call Response: 
 
98J1 The Distress Alarm sounds and the screen readout no longer contains the particulars of the Distress: 
 
A. The particulars are rarely routed to the printer so it is of no use to examine the printer.   
B. Examine the Transmitted Data Directory or the printer to recover the information. 
C. Call the Distress vessel on the DSC frequency and request a retransmission. 
D. Examine the Received Data Directory or the printer to recover the information. 
 
98J2 A DSC Distress call is received by your vessel and your transceiver frequency display reads: 
Transmit = 4207.5 kHz and Receive = 4207.5 kHz with J3E emission -- what information can you infer from this? 
 
A. The DSC call requested voice on 4207.5 kHz simplex but the requested alternate frequency is improper.  
B. The DSC controller decoded the requested voice frequency as 4207.5 kHz simplex and your DSC controller 
has automatically set-up your transceiver and therefore the requested alternate frequency is correct. 
C. The DSC call came in on 4 MHz DSC. You should set-up your transmitter and respond on the appropriate 
voice follow-on frequency of 4177.5 kHz. 
D. The DSC call came in on 4 MHz DSC. You should set-up your transmitter and respond on the appropriate 
voice follow-on frequency of 4207.5 kHz. 
 
98J3 What are potential dangers of automatic transceiver switching in response to a DSC call? 
 
A. Incorrectly formatted DSC calls from other vessels result in a warning in the DSC alarm screen but the vessel 
still might be switched to an illegal or improper outcome. 
B. The transceiver may be switched out of the marine bands or the frequency may not match the requested 
priority or emission. 
C. The automatic transceiver switching software always detects improper priorities, emissions & frequencies to 
ensure there is no danger. 
D. The automatic transceiver switching feature always interrupting safe navigation of your own vessel and 
placing the unit on the GMDSS Distress, Urgency or Safety follow-on frequencies. 
 
98J4 Which of these would not be a bad outcome of an Urgency DSC call to all vessels specifying an alternate 
TELEX frequency & emission that cause your transceiver to automatically switch?  
 
A. The DSC controller decoded the contents of the DSC call and the requested frequency is not on the DUS 
table/placard but is in the marine band frequencies in the J2B emission. 
B.  The  DSC  controller  decoded  the  contents  of  the  DSC  call  and  the  requested  frequency  is  on  the  DUS 
table/placard in the J3E emission. 
C.  The  DSC  controller  decoded  the  contents  of  the  DSC  call  and  the  requested  frequency  is  on  the  DUS 
table/placard in the J2B emission. 
D. The DSC controller decoded the contents of the DSC call and the requested frequency is not on the DUS 
table/placard, is not in the marine band or the other vessel requested a J3E emission. 
 
98J5 An incoming Distress priority 16 MHz DSC call requesting J3E emission might automatically switch to what 
frequency?  
 
A. 16420.0 MHz 
B. 16696.5 kHz 
C. 16420.0 kHz 
D. 16804.5 kHz 
 
98J6 An incoming DSC Distress alert on 8414.5 kHz will have what result? 
 
A. The DSC controller will emit both an audible and visual alarm. 
B. The particulars of the alert may be printed out. 
C. The Distress information contained in the alert will be sent to the data directory. 
D. All of these answers would typically occur.
